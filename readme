Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

The assignment was extremely interesting because it was my first actual
project in assembly. Working on optimization in assembly itself was
also intellectually challenging and fun. I would say that this is my
favorite assignment out of all the assignments. I would definitely want
to learn more about assembly after this assignment.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

No bugs, however here are the edits I made for 2f:

- The 3 edits specified in the specification
- Calculated the auldigits memory addresses before the for loop
- made it so the smaller number is the oAddEnd1 and larger number is
  oAddEnd2. This allowed for a easier implementation of adcs
- increased index by 8 (bytes) so I can just do an add instead of an
  LSL 3 along with an add at every loop (for getting the aulDigits value
  at a certain index).
